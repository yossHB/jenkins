## Overview
### Definition
Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place. The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how Jenkins works.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.


## Jenkins Architecture
Jenkins follows Master-Slave architecture to manage distributed builds. In this architecture, slave and master communicate through TCP/IP prot

Jenkins architecture has two components:

   - Jenkins Master/Server
   - Jenkins Slave/Node/Build Server

## Jenkins Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.


## Downloads
The Jenkins project provides official distributions as WAR files, Docker images, native packages and installers for platforms including several Linux distributions and Windows. See the [Downloads][Downloads] page for references.
